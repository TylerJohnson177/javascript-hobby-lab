                <h3>Introduction</h3>

                <p>Ice Fishing can be a fun sport, but there are a few safety precautions you should take
                to have the best experience and to have fun, first, make sure there is at least 4 inches of ice where you are fishing,
                ice thickness can change in a matter of feet, especially if you are fishing on a river with flowing water, you should check ice
                thickness as you walk. next, make sure you bring warm clothing, sitting outside in the middle of a frozen
                lake will get chilly, especially if there is a brisk wind, bringing a foldable ice shanty is also recommended on cold days.
                finally, remember to bring snacks, bringing a few candy bars, chips, and soda will go a long way on the lake.</p>

        <p>Almost all lakes in Northern Wisconsin remain frozen for almost 6 months every winter.
        Northern Wisconsin lakes typically freeze over in mid November, and remain frozen until the second
        week in April!  At the same time, lake temps in the summer usually excede 80 degrees!, that is quite a
            temperature difference.</p>
